Good code, with a good structure and which is very readable.

Only minor problem as I see it is that you could have done a bit more testing of edge cases such as:
- An empty array.
- An array consisting only of the same element.

Your implementation did however pass those tests, 
but it would have been better if you had done those tests yourself.

Also a very well written rapport which answers everything correctly, 
again with the only minor exception being the insuficient testing of edge cases.

All in all great work!
